# Write Performance

Paimon's write performance is closely related to checkpoint, so if you need greater write throughput:

1. Increase the checkpoint interval, or just use batch mode.
2. Increase `write-buffer-size`.
3. Enable `write-buffer-spillable`.
4. Rescale bucket number if you are using Fixed-Bucket mode.

Option `'changelog-producer' = 'lookup' or 'full-compaction'`, and option `'full-compaction.delta-commits'` have a
large impact on write performance, if it is a snapshot / full synchronization phase you can unset these options and
then enable them on again when needed in the incremental phase.

## Parallelism

It is recommended that the parallelism of sink should be less than or equal to the number of buckets, preferably equal. You can control the parallelism of the sink with the `sink.parallelism` table property.

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 20%">Option</th>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 5%">Required</th>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 5%">Default</th>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 10%">Type</th>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 60%">Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>sink.parallelism</h5></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td style="word-wrap: break-word;">(none)</td>
      <td>Integer</td>
      <td>Defines the parallelism of the sink operator. By default, the parallelism is determined by the framework using the same parallelism of the upstream chained operator.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Compaction

### Asynchronous Compaction

Compaction is inherently asynchronous, but if you want it to be completely asynchronous and not blocking writing,
expect a mode to have maximum write throughput, the compaction can be done slowly and not in a hurry.
You can use the following strategies for your table:

```shell
num-sorted-run.stop-trigger = 2147483647
sort-spill-threshold = 10
```

This configuration will generate more files during peak write periods and gradually merge into optimal read
performance during low write periods.

### Number of Sorted Runs to Pause Writing

When number of sorted runs is small, Paimon writers will perform compaction asynchronously in separated threads, so
records can be continuously written into the table. However to avoid unbounded growth of sorted runs, writers will
have to pause writing when the number of sorted runs hits the threshold. The following table property determines
the threshold.

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 20%">Option</th>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 5%">Required</th>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 5%">Default</th>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 10%">Type</th>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 60%">Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>num-sorted-run.stop-trigger</h5></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td style="word-wrap: break-word;">(none)</td>
      <td>Integer</td>
      <td>The number of sorted runs that trigger the stopping of writes, the default value is 'num-sorted-run.compaction-trigger' + 1.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Write stalls will become less frequent when `num-sorted-run.stop-trigger` becomes larger, thus improving writing
performance. However, if this value becomes too large, more memory and CPU time will be needed when querying the
table. If you are concerned about the OOM of memory, please configure the following option `sort-spill-threshold`.
Its value depends on your memory size.

### Number of Sorted Runs to Trigger Compaction

Paimon uses [LSM tree]({{< ref "concepts/file-layouts#lsm-trees" >}}) which supports a large number of updates. LSM organizes files in several [sorted runs]({{< ref "concepts/file-layouts#sorted-runs" >}}). When querying records from an LSM tree, all sorted runs must be combined to produce a complete view of all records.

One can easily see that too many sorted runs will result in poor query performance. To keep the number of sorted runs in a reasonable range, Paimon writers will automatically perform [compactions]({{< ref "concepts/file-layouts#compaction" >}}). The following table property determines the minimum number of sorted runs to trigger a compaction.

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 20%">Option</th>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 5%">Required</th>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 5%">Default</th>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 10%">Type</th>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 60%">Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>num-sorted-run.compaction-trigger</h5></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td style="word-wrap: break-word;">5</td>
      <td>Integer</td>
      <td>The sorted run number to trigger compaction. Includes level0 files (one file one sorted run) and high-level runs (one level one sorted run).</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Compaction will become less frequent when `num-sorted-run.compaction-trigger` becomes larger, thus improving writing performance. However, if this value becomes too large, more memory and CPU time will be needed when querying the table. This is a trade-off between writing and query performance.

## File Format

If you want to achieve ultimate compaction performance, you can consider using row storage file format AVRO.
- The advantage is that you can achieve high write throughput and compaction performance.
- The disadvantage is that your analysis queries will be slow, and the biggest problem with row storage is that it
  does not have the query projection. For example, if the table have 100 columns but only query a few columns, the
  IO of row storage cannot be ignored. Additionally, compression efficiency will decrease and storage costs will
  increase.

This a tradeoff.

Enable row storage through the following options:
```shell
file.format = avro
metadata.stats-mode = none
```

The collection of statistical information for row storage is a bit expensive, so I suggest turning off statistical
information as well.

If you don't want to modify all files to Avro format, at least you can consider modifying the files in the previous
layers to Avro format. You can use `'file.format.per.level' = '0:avro,1:avro'` to specify the files in the first two
layers to be in Avro format.

## File Compression

By default, Paimon uses high-performance compression algorithms such as LZ4 and SNAPPY. But their compression rate
will be not so good. If you can reduce the write/read performance, you can modify the compression algorithm:

1. `'file.compression'`: Default file compression format. If you need a higher compression rate, I recommend using `'ZSTD'`.
2. `'file.compression.per.level'`: Define different compression policies for different level. For example `'0:lz4,1:zstd'`.

## Stability

If there are too few buckets, or too few resources, full-compaction may cause checkpoint to timeout, Flink's default
checkpoint timeout is 10 minutes.

If you expect stability even in this case, you can turn up the checkpoint timeout, for example:

```shell
execution.checkpointing.timeout = 60 min
```

## Write Initialize

In the initialization of write, the writer of the bucket needs to read all historical files. If there is a bottleneck
here (For example, writing a large number of partitions simultaneously), you can use `write-manifest-cache` to cache
the read manifest data to accelerate initialization.

## Memory

There are three main places in Paimon writer that takes up memory:

* Writer's memory buffer, shared and preempted by all writers of a single task. This memory value can be adjusted by the `write-buffer-size` table property.
* Memory consumed when merging several sorted runs for compaction. Can be adjusted by the `num-sorted-run.compaction-trigger` option to change the number of sorted runs to be merged.
* If the row is very large, reading too many lines of data at once can consume a lot of memory when making a compaction. Reducing the `read.batch-size` option can alleviate the impact of this case.
* The memory consumed by writing columnar (ORC, Parquet, etc.) file. Decreasing the `orc.write.batch-size` option can reduce the consume of memory for ORC format.
* If files are automatically compaction in the write task, dictionaries for certain large columns can significantly consume memory during compaction. You can disable data dictionaries by using `fields.{fieldName}.dictionary-enable`, or disable dictionaries for all fields using the configuration `format.dictionary-enable`.

If your Flink job does not rely on state, please avoid using managed memory, which you can control with the following Flink parameters:
```shell
taskmanager.memory.managed.size=1m
```
